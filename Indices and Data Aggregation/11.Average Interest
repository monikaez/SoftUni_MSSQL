--11.Average Interest 
-- Mr. Bodrog is highly interested in profitability. 
-- He wants to know the average interest of all deposit groups, split by whether the deposit has expired or not.
--  But that's not all. He wants you to select deposits with start date after 01/01/1985.
--   Order the data descending by Deposit Group and ascending by Expiration Flag.
