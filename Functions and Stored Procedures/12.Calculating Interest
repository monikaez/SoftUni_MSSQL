--12.Calculating Interest
-- Your task is to create a stored procedure usp_CalculateFutureValueForAccount that uses the function from the previous problem 
-- to give an interest to a person's account for 5 years, along with information about their account id, first name, last name and current balance 
-- as it is shown in the example below. 
-- It should take the AccountId and the interest rate as parameters. Again, you are provided with the dbo.ufn_CalculateFutureValue function,
-- which was part of the previous task.
CREATE PROCEDURE usp_CalculateFutureValueForAccount
(@accId INT, @interestRate FLOAT)
AS
SELECT a.Id
      ,ah.FirstName AS [First Name]
	  ,ah.LastName AS [Last Name]
	  ,a.Balance AS [Current Balance]
	  ,dbo.ufn_CalculateFutureValue(a.Balance, @interestRate, 5) AS [Balance in 5 years]
FROM AccountHolders AS ah
JOIN Accounts AS a ON ah.Id = a.AccountHolderId
WHERE a.Id = @accId
