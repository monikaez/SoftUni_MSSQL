--17.Highest Peak and Longest River by Country
--For each country, find the elevation of the highest peak and the length of the longest river,
 --sorted by the highest peak elevation (from highest to lowest), 
 --then by the longest river length (from longest to smallest), then by country name (alphabetically).
 --Display NULL when no data is available in some of the columns. Limit only the first 5 rows.
